If you've forgotten the password for your Mattermost administrator account and don't have an email server configured, you can reset the password manually using the Mattermost command-line interface (`mmctl`). Here's how:

1. **Access the Mattermost Server:**
   - Log in to the server where Mattermost is installed.

2. **Enable Local Mode:**
   - Edit the `config.json` file located in your Mattermost installation directory (commonly `/opt/mattermost`).
   - Set `"EnableLocalMode": true` in the `ServiceSettings` section.
   - Save the changes and restart the Mattermost service to apply the new configuration.

3. **Reset the Admin Password:**
   - Navigate to the Mattermost installation directory.
   - Execute the following command to reset the password:
     ```
     mmctl --local user change-password your_admin_username --password new_secure_password
     ```
     Replace `your_admin_username` with your actual admin username and `new_secure_password` with a strong, new password.

For more detailed information on using `mmctl` for password resets, refer to the Mattermost documentation.

Alternatively, if you prefer to set up an email server to utilize the password reset feature via email, you can configure an SMTP service compatible with Mattermost. Detailed instructions for setting up SMTP email services with Mattermost are available in the Mattermost User Guide.

Ensure that after setting up the email server, you configure Mattermost to use it by updating the email settings in the System Console under `Notifications > Email`.


To restart your Mattermost server, the command depends on how Mattermost was installed and is managed on your system. Here are common methods:

**1. Using Systemd (Typical for Linux Systems):**

If Mattermost is managed as a systemd service, you can restart it with:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart mattermost
```


To check the status of the Mattermost service:

```bash
sudo systemctl status mattermost
```

**2. Using Docker:**

If Mattermost is running inside a Docker container, identify the container name using:

```bash
docker ps
```


Then, restart the container with:

```bash
docker restart <container_name>
```


Replace `<container_name>` with your actual Mattermost container name.

**3. Using the Mattermost Command-Line Interface (`mmctl`):**

If you have `mmctl` set up and local mode enabled, you can reload the server configuration:

```bash
mmctl --local config reload
```


This command applies new settings without a full restart. citeturn0search4

**4. Manually Starting the Server:**

If Mattermost isn't managed by systemd or Docker, you can manually start it by navigating to the installation directory and running:

```bash
./bin/mattermost
```

**Note:** The exact method to restart Mattermost depends on your installation and system configuration. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and consult your system administrator if needed.
