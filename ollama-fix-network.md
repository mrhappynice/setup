To make Ollama accessible on your local network, you'll need to configure it to listen on an IP address that allows connections from other devices, rather than the default `127.0.0.1` (which restricts access to the local machine). Here's how you can do this:

**1. Set the `OLLAMA_HOST` Environment Variable:**

By setting the `OLLAMA_HOST` environment variable to `0.0.0.0`, you instruct Ollama to listen on all available network interfaces, making it accessible from other devices on your local network.

**For Linux Systems:**

- **If Ollama is managed by `systemd`:**

  1. **Edit the Ollama service configuration:**

     ```bash
     sudo systemctl edit ollama.service
     ```

  2. **Add the following lines:**

     ```
     [Service]
     Environment="OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0"
     ```

     Ensure these lines are placed above any comment lines that indicate where new content should go.

  3. **Save and exit the editor.**

  4. **Reload the systemd configuration and restart the Ollama service:**

     ```bash
     sudo systemctl daemon-reload
     sudo systemctl restart ollama
     ```

     This ensures that the changes take effect and Ollama starts listening on all network interfaces.

- **If you're running Ollama manually from the command line:**

  1. **Export the `OLLAMA_HOST` variable and start Ollama:**

     ```bash
     export OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0
     ollama serve
     ```

     This command sets the environment variable for the current session and starts Ollama, making it accessible from other devices on the network.

**For Windows Systems:**

1. **Set the `OLLAMA_HOST` environment variable:**

   - **Through the System Properties:**

     - Open the **System Properties** window (you can search for "Environment Variables" in the Start menu).

     - Click on **Environment Variables**.

     - Under **System variables**, click **New** and add:

       - **Variable name:** `OLLAMA_HOST`

       - **Variable value:** `0.0.0.0`

     - Click **OK** to save the changes.

   - **Through the Command Prompt:**

     ```cmd
     setx OLLAMA_HOST "0.0.0.0"
     ```

     This command sets the environment variable persistently.

2. **Restart the Ollama application** to apply the changes.

**2. Verify Network Accessibility:**

After configuring Ollama to listen on all interfaces, ensure that your system's firewall settings allow incoming connections on the port Ollama uses (default is `11434`).

**3. Test the Connection:**

From another device on your local network, you can test the connection using `curl` or a web browser:

- **Using `curl`:**

  ```bash
  curl http://<your-computer-ip>:11434
  ```

- **Using a web browser:**

  Navigate to `http://<your-computer-ip>:11434`

Replace `<your-computer-ip>` with the IP address of the machine running Ollama.

**Security Considerations:**

Exposing Ollama on your local network can have security implications. Ensure that your network is secure and consider implementing additional security measures, such as setting up a reverse proxy with authentication, to control access.

By following these steps, you should be able to run Ollama on your local network, making it accessible to other devices.

On Linux  

Edit the ollama.service using the following command  

sudo systemctl edit ollama.service  

Add the following environment variables  

[Service]
Environment="OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0"  
Environment="OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*"

Then restart the ollama service

sudo service ollama restart

Testing

Your output should be like below if everything is setup right for Origins

(base) âžœ  ~ curl -X OPTIONS http://localhost:11434 -H "Origin: http://example.com" -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET" -I
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization,Content-Type,User-Agent,Accept,X-Requested-With,X-Stainless-Lang,X-Stainless-Package-Version,X-Stainless-Os,X-Stainless-Arch,X-Stainless-Runtime,X-Stainless-Runtime-Version,X-Stainless-Async

to make sure binding is correct, run the following command

(base) gavi@node1:~$ netstat -an |grep 11434
tcp6       0      0 :::11434                :::*                    LISTEN

As you can see the port is bound to all IPs on the machine
